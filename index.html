        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>
            Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body is unable to effectively process food into energy. This is primarily due to issues with insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. There are two main types of diabetes:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> This occurs when the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. It often develops in childhood or adolescence.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> This is the most common form, occurring when the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is often associated with lifestyle factors and usually develops in adults, though it can also occur in children and teenagers.
